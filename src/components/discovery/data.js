    <strong>RANKING</strong> the seven governance issues discussed in this book is, in a real sense, daring. However, having devoted over six decades to the study and observation of the different dimensions of the issues, I feel comfortable in making this ranking. I would argue that implementing a devolved federation is the first step towards making Nigeria a well-performing state that is capable of achieving good development performance. Next, I would give second ranking jointly to electoral legitimacy, rule of law, and civil liberties. Development-oriented leadership, administrative competence and accountability and transparency (including anti-corruption) would follow in that order. Of course, there are significant overlaps that complicate this ranking.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Sequencing:</strong> to turn around the prevailing combination of poor governance performance and poor development performance in Nigeria, governance reform should begin with the adoption and implementation of a devolved federation for emphasis, only a devolved Nigerian federation can become a well-performing state that is capable of achieving good development performance. Within the devolved federation, the federal government and each of the subnational governments in the federation should be responsible for sequencing the six other governance reforms highlighted, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of their respective governance structures and processes.

     <p>Everyday hundreds on Nigerians are injured, paralysed or disfigured and another hundreds are killed suddenly or die a slow painful death. This wanton and colossal destructive lives, limbs, blood and bone, tears and tear, money and men, is a thousand times more grievous than the threat armed robbery and other violent crimes pose to our society's security. It goes without saying, therefore, that the socio-economic and psychological effects of these accidents are quite staggering. Yet it seems both unfortunate and ironical since most of these road traffic accidents are quite preventable.
</p>
      <p>The situation becomes even more disturbing when it is realised that the impact of these accidents is most striking in the economically productive age group, whether they are victims or survivors.
</p>
       <p>Mindful of this real threat, the author, a medical practitioner, who believes in the age long adage that, 'Prevention is better than cure' provides a holistic reappraisal on the causes of road traffic accidents and how they can be avoided.
</p>
        <p>While the messages of Part I is preventive, Part II of the book adopt a curative approach. It provides basic guidelines on First Aid measures and emergency care to be given to the unfortunate casualties of RTAs, which decisively contributes to the survival or death of the victims; and many cases determine the extent of temporary or permanent disability.
</p>
         <p>This well-written and concise handbook will be of benefit to every road user who listens to its powerful appeal. Thus, this book is a compulsory reading for all Nigerian road users, who are conscious of their own survival in a society that is at war with itself!</p>

      The book is based on the presentations made at the lju Public Affairs Forum Series between 2006 and 2009. The single theme that runs through all the chapters of the book is how best to improve Nigeria's development performance.
      </p>
      <p>
      While the specific topics covered range from political and economic affairs to education, culture, religion and gender, the analysis in each chapter and the recommendations proposed by the different authors focus on how the poor/mediocre development performance record of the country during its first fifty years of independence could be turned around. Overall, the contents of the book cover several of the critical development challenges that Nigeria faced during the first decade of the 21" century. To a great extent, these are the same key development challenges the country faced during the closing decades of the last century; and there is a real sense in which they would qualify as important challenges for the next couple of decades. The contents of several chapters of the book are enriched by the comparative perspectives provided on development experiences of some countries inside and outside Africa.
